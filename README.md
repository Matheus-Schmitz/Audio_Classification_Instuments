# Audio_Classification_Instuments
In this project I explored Kapre's custom Keras layer for calculating MelSpectrograms online.
This vastly reduces the need for preprocessing audio data before feeding a neural network.
I've used the customized neural network to classify the sounds of 10 different instruments

The first part of this project was a baseline model without Kapre (Audio_Classification_Instruments).
The second part uses Kapre (Kapre_NN_2)
